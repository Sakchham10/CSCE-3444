This is a personal project and a personal challenge to try to create a webapp without the use of frameworks or libraries like React or Angular to expand my knowledge of base javascript.
This proejct only uses EJS,JS,CSS,MongoDB,Express and NodeJS as its main techology.
I have used different APIs such as mapbox, Joi and Password to simulate the real life workings of the Yelp app.
