This is a personal project and a personal challenge to try to create a webapp without the use of frameworks or libraries like React or Angular.
This proejct only uses EJS,JS,CSS,MongoDB,Express and NodeJS as its main techology.

The above link will take you to the final release of the web application, hosted on heroku servers.
I have used different APIs such as mapbox, Joi and Password to simulate the real life workings of the Yelp app.
